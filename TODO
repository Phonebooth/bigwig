- "grep mode" correlator that will correlate the ids found on the first line
  that contains some other string.  Meaning that you are grepping for an error
  and as soon as it occurs dump all the correlated data.

- Option to include log file lines within a line range that encompasses
  a correlation, but are not necessarily correlated.  Or maybe just those
  lines within the line range and another pattern (like a pid).  Thinking
  about rtp_connection logs.

- Support for lines that do not match the line regex

- Pre-correlated results saved to a file

- Streaming support (tail -F console.log | bigwig -c ...)

- Multi-file support
