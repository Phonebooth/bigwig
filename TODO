- Option to include log file lines within a line range that encompasses
  a correlation, but are not necessarily correlated.  Or maybe just those
  lines within the line range and another pattern (like a pid).  Thinking
  about rtp_connection logs.

- Support for lines that do not match the line regex

- Pre-correlated results saved to a file

- Streaming support (tail -F console.log | bigwig -c ...)

- Multi-file support
